#    Fake Review Detection Using NLP
# Overview
Online reviews significantly influence consumer decisions, making the integrity of these reviews crucial for both customers and businesses. The rise of fake reviews has introduced challenges in maintaining this integrity. This project aims to develop a robust framework for detecting fake reviews using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing the text and ratings of reviews, the proposed model seeks to identify deceptive patterns indicative of fraudulence across various domains.
